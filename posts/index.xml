This is a culture from the company that I worked for that I applied to my personal life. I think this activity affects me (in a good way of course). Are you interested in doing it?
ðŸ¥© Main Course How was your day?
Thatâ€™s one powerful question I got daily â€” on weekdays â€” from the team in a company that I worked for.</description></item><item><title>Cool Peeps</title><link>https://rgxcp.github.io/northernchateau.dev/posts/2022/06/2-cool-peeps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 20:50:22 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://rgxcp.github.io/northernchateau.dev/posts/2022/06/2-cool-peeps/</guid><description>puts &amp;#34;Are you?&amp;#34; ðŸ¥‘ Appetizer I keep my circle small. Not because I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be Michael Corleone, but because I&amp;rsquo;m simply an introverted-socially awkward person (in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t get it, it&amp;rsquo;s a joke ðŸ™€).
Not a lot of people come into my life. So, if you see your name in here, it means â€” you guessed it â€” you&amp;rsquo;re cool peeps!

Welcome aboard!
Welcome to this (super simple) blog. Here, I will be sharing some tutorials, tips, or just some info related to techs, films, music, designs, or anything that pops from my mind.
Why am I doing this? Simple, as they said: &amp;ldquo;The best way to learn is to teach&amp;rdquo;. I think it&amp;rsquo;s cool if I can share my knowledge. I think it&amp;rsquo;s amazing if others can benefit from what I know.</description></item></channel></rss>
