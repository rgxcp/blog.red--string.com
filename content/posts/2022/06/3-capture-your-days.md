Writing a daily diary has been my favorite activity for the past month. This is a culture from the company that I worked for that I applied to my personal life. I think this activity affects me (in a good way of course). Are you interested in doing it?

> How was your day?

That‚Äôs one powerful question I got daily ‚Äî on weekdays ‚Äî from the team in a company that I worked for. Every day, from 4.45 to 5.30 pm, we will have a **_Show and Tell_** meeting session. In this meeting, every person on the team will present what they have been working on for the day or something interesting that happens on that day. We can also use this session to ask for help, raise concerns, clear some paths, etc.

It's such a unique and fun thing to do. So I was like: **_"Why don't I apply it to my personal life? Write how was my day in a diary?"_**. And here I‚Äôm, one month passed of doing it, and still going strong. I'm always happy writing it and happy to be able to recall my days, whether it was an amazing or a bad day.

I use [Joyko](https://www.tokopedia.com/joyko/notebook-buku-tulis-catatan-diary-agenda-joyko-soft-cover-red-a6) for my diary book, A6 size because it's compact, with red color because... I don't know, it seems kinda cool and has a mysterious vibe üòÖ

So, after reading this post, are you already make-up your mind?

That's it for today's post, folks!

Quoting one of the most famous phrases in software engineering: **_"It works on my machine"_**, I hope this activity also **_"works"_** on your **_"machine"_**!
